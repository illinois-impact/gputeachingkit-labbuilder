# Objective

The purpose of this lab is to introduce the student to the
CUDA hardware resources along with their capabilities.
The student is not expected to understand the details of
the code, but should understand the process of compiling
and running code that will be used in subsequent modules.

# Instructions

The code provided queries the GPU hardware on the system.
Do not concentrate on the API calls, but on functions starting with `wb`.

The `wbLog` function logs results, specifically we log the following hardware features:

* GPU card's name

* GPU computation capabilities

* Maximum number of block dimensions

* Maximum number of grid dimensions

* Maximum size of GPU memory

* Amount of constant and share memory

* Warp size

The details and meaning of these quantities will be explained in the first and second modules of the teaching kit.

# Local Setup Instructions

The most recent version of source code for this lab along with the build-scripts can be found on the [Bitbucket repository](LINKTOLAB). A description on how to use the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) tool in along with how to build the labs for local development found in the [README](LINKTOREADME) document in the root of the repository.

The executable generated as a result of compiling the lab can be run using the following command:

~~~
./DeviceQuery_Template
