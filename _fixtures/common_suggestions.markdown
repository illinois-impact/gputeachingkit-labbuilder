* The system's autosave feature is not an excuse to not backup your code and answers to your questions regularly.

* If you have not done so already, read the [tutorial](/help)

* Do not modify the template code provided -- only insert code where the `//@@` demarcation is placed

* Develop your solution incrementally and test each version thoroughly before moving on to the next version

* Do not wait until the last minute to attempt the lab.

* If you get stuck with boundary conditions, grab a pen and paper. It is much easier to figure out the boundary conditions there.

* Implement the serial CPU version first, this will give you an understanding of the loops

* Get the first dataset working first. The datasets are ordered so the first one is the easiest to handle

* Make sure that your algorithm handles non-regular dimensional inputs (not square or multiples of 2).
The slides may present the algorithm with nice inputs, since it minimizes the conditions.
The datasets reflect different sizes of input that you are expected to handle

* Make sure that you test your program using all the datasets provided (the datasets can be selected using the dropdown next to the submission button)

* Check for errors: for example, when developing CUDA code, one can check for if the function call succeeded and print an error if not via the following macro:

        #define wbCheck(stmt) do {                                                    \
                cudaError_t err = stmt;                                               \
                if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                             \
                    wbLog(ERROR, "Failed to run stmt ", #stmt);                       \
                    wbLog(ERROR, "Got CUDA error ...  ", cudaGetErrorString(err));    \
                    return -1;                                                        \
                }                                                                     \
            } while(0)


An example usage is `wbCheck(cudaMalloc(...))`. A similar macro can be
developed while programming OpenCL code.

# Plagiarism

Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
The first offense will result in the two parties getting a 0 for the machine problem.
Second offense results in a 0 for the course.

# Grading

Grading is performed based on criteria that are specific for each lab.

<!--
You will be graded not only on the code, but also on peer reviewing other people.
-->

For each attempt in the attempts tab, you'll see a *submit for grading* button.

![Attempt](/help/imgs/attempt.png "thumbnail")

Clicking on that would tell the system to grade that attempt and redirect you to the grade report page.


![Grade](/help/imgs/grade.png "thumbnail")

The grades are automatically sent to Coursera.
You will have to submit your grade back to Coursera by clicking the button submit to Coursera button.

Note: you cannot submit code for grading after the corresponding deadlines have passed.


# Local Development

While not required, the library used throughout the course can be
downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/abduld/libwb). The library
does not depend on any external library (and should be cross platform),
you can use `make` to generate the shared object file (further
instructions are found on the Github page). Linking against the library
would allow you to get similar behavior to the web interface (minus the
imposed limitations). Once linked against the library, you can launch
your program as follows:

~~~
    ./program -e <expected_output_file> -i <input_file_1>,<input_file_2> -o <output_file> -t <type>
~~~

The `<expected_output_file>` and `<input_file_n>` are the input and output
files provided in the dataset. The `<output_file>` is the location you'd
like to place the output from your program. The `<type>` is the output
file type: `vector`, `matrix`, or `image`. If an MP does not expect an
input or output, then pass `none` as the parameter.

In case of issues or suggestions with the library, please report them
through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/abduld/libwb/issues) on Github.
